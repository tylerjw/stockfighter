# Welcome to Your New Job
These instructions are always available under the Instructions tab if you need to see them again.

Congrats on being employed at BrainSmile Bank. We're sure you'll love it here. You have been granted control over account BSB86986720 and have full authority to conduct trades on it... subject to the not-so-watchful eye of our risk management desk, naturally.

First order of business: This is a blotter interface. It connects your terminal to DeathBlossom Vienna Board of Trade (DBVBEX), a well-regarded stock exchange. We've pre-loaded it to track your first assignment, the shares of AULY Ltd. (AULY).

## Your Goal
Get acquainted with this interface.
Watch the market participants trade a bit.
When you're ready, purchase 100 shares. (Try using a market order. Not sure about what that means? Read about Order Types in the instructions menu.)

## You'll Be Fired If
The risk management desk is at an offsite today. Parachuting into a volcano, apparently. No rules until Monday!
